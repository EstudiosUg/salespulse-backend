# Export Email Feature Fix

## Issue
The data export feature from the settings screen was not sending emails with the exported data, and notifications were not showing in the app.

## Root Cause
The backend `exportData` method in `UserController.php` was only generating the Excel file but not sending it via email. The frontend expected an `email_sent` flag in the response, which was missing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - UserController.php (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserController.php`)

#### Added Mail facade import:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
```

#### Updated `exportData` method to:
- Generate Excel file with user data (Sales & Expenses)
- Send email with Excel file attached
- Return `email_sent` status in API response
- Include detailed email message with export details
- Handle email failures gracefully (logs error but doesn't fail the request)

#### Email Features:
- **Subject**: "Your Data Export - SalesPulse"
- **Recipient**: User's registered email address
- **Attachment**: Excel file with sales and expense data
- **Content**: 
  - Personalized greeting with user name
  - Date range of exported data
  - What data was included (Sales/Expenses)
  - Professional email signature

#### API Response now includes:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Data exported successfully",
  "data": {
    "download_url": "/storage/exports/filename.xlsx",
    "filename": "data_export_123_2025_01_17_12_00_00.xlsx",
    "email_sent": true,
    "file_name": "data_export_123_2025_01_17_12_00_00.xlsx"
  }
}
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Fixed `.env` mail settings:
- Changed `MAIL_MAILER=SMTP` to `MAIL_MAILER=smtp` (lowercase)
- Changed `MAIL_SCHEME=null` to `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl`
- Configured Hostinger SMTP:
  - Host: `smtp.hostinger.com`
  - Port: `465`
  - Encryption: `ssl`
  - Username: `info@estudios.ug`

### 3. Directory Setup
- Verified `storage/app/public/exports/` directory exists
- Confirmed storage symlink is properly configured
- Cleared Laravel configuration and application cache

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. User opens Settings screen in Flutter app
2. User taps "Export Data" (Premium feature)
3. User selects date range and data types (Sales/Expenses)
4. User taps "Export" button

### Backend Process:
1. ✅ Validates user has premium subscription
2. ✅ Queries sales and expense data for date range
3. ✅ Generates Excel file with formatted data
4. ✅ Stores file in `storage/app/public/exports/`
5. ✅ Sends email to user with file attached
6. ✅ Returns response with download URL and email status

### Frontend Process:
1. ✅ Receives API response
2. ✅ Shows notification: "Export Sent via Email"
3. ✅ Shows snackbar: "Export sent to your email successfully!"
4. ✅ Downloads file to device (if download URL available)
5. ✅ Shows snackbar: "Downloading export file..."

## Testing

### Test Export Functionality:
1. Open the Flutter app
2. Login with a premium account
3. Go to Settings screen
4. Tap "Export Data"
5. Select date range (e.g., last month)
6. Check both Sales and Expenses
7. Tap "Export"
8. Verify:
   - ✅ Success notification appears
   - ✅ Email arrives with Excel attachment
   - ✅ File downloads to device
   - ✅ Excel file contains correct data

### Expected Email Content:
```
Hello [User Name],

Your data export is ready!

Export Details:
- Date Range: 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-31
- Sales Data: Included
- Expenses Data: Included

Please find your exported data attached to this email.

Best regards,
SalesPulse Team

## Files Modified
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserController.php` - Added email functionality to exportData method
2. `.env` - Fixed mail configuration (backup saved to `.env.backup`)
3. `.env` - Updated `APP_URL` to match Flutter app IP address (`http://192.168.110.151:8000`)

## Download URL Fix
**Issue**: Download was failing with "no host specified in uri/storage..."  
**Root Cause**: `Storage::url()` returns relative path `/storage/exports/file.xlsx` instead of full URL  
**Solution**: Wrapped with `url()` helper to generate full URL: `http://192.168.110.151:8000/storage/exports/file.xlsx`

## Dependencies
- ✅ Maatwebsite Excel package (already installed)
- ✅ Laravel Mail facade (built-in)
- ✅ Hostinger SMTP configured
- ✅ Storage link configured

## Error Handling
- If email fails to send, the error is logged but the export still succeeds
- User gets the file via download URL as backup
- Frontend shows appropriate messages based on `email_sent` flag
- Graceful degradation: File download works even if email fails

## Future Enhancements
1. Create a custom Mailable class for better email templating
2. Add email queue support for better performance
3. Add option to resend email if not received
4. Support multiple email formats (HTML)
5. Add email preview before sending

## Troubleshooting

### Email not received:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address is correct in user profile
- Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Verify SMTP credentials in `.env`

### File not downloading:
- Check storage permissions
- Verify storage link exists: `php artisan storage:link`
- Check exports directory exists: `storage/app/public/exports/`

### Permission issues:
- Ensure user has premium subscription
- Check `canExportData()` method on User model
