# Login/Logout Navigation Fix

## Issue
When an account was logged out and a user tried logging in with another account, the app didn't navigate to the main screen until it was closed and reopened. This was causing frustration as users couldn't immediately access the app after login.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two main problems:

1. **Navigation Flow Problem**: After logout, the app navigated to the `/login` route and removed all previous routes including the `AuthWrapper`. When the user logged in again, the auth state changed but no navigation occurred because the `AuthWrapper` (which watches auth state and handles navigation) was no longer in the widget tree.

2. **Cached Data Problem**: User-specific data (sales, expenses, suppliers, profile) was cached in Riverpod StateNotifierProviders. When logging out and logging in with a different account, the old user's data would briefly appear until new data was loaded.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Login Navigation (`login_screen.dart`)
After successful login, explicitly navigate to the dashboard:
```dart
// Navigate to dashboard after successful login
if (mounted) {
  Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
    '/dashboard',
    (route) => false,
  );
}
```

This ensures that after login succeeds, the app immediately navigates to the main app screen.

### 2. Fixed Logout Data Clearing (`settings_screen.dart`)
Before logout, invalidate all data providers to clear cached data:
```dart
// Clear all cached data before logout
ref.invalidate(salesNotifierProvider);
ref.invalidate(expensesNotifierProvider);
ref.invalidate(suppliersNotifierProvider);
ref.invalidate(profileNotifierProvider);
ref.invalidate(settingsNotifierProvider);

await ref.read(authNotifierProvider.notifier).logout();
```

This ensures that when a new user logs in, they don't see the previous user's data.

### 3. Applied Same Fix to Delete Account Flow
The same data clearing and navigation fixes were applied to the delete account functionality to maintain consistency.

## Files Modified
1. `salespulse/lib/screens/login_screen.dart` - Added explicit navigation after successful login
2. `salespulse/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Added data provider invalidation before logout and account deletion

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Log in with an account
2. Add some sales/expenses data
3. Log out
4. Log in with a different account
5. Verify that:
   - The app immediately navigates to the dashboard after login (no need to close/reopen)
   - No data from the previous user is visible
   - The new user can use the app normally

## Technical Details
- Uses `Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil()` to clear navigation stack and push new route
- Uses `ref.invalidate()` to reset Riverpod StateNotifierProviders
- Maintains proper mounted checks to prevent navigation after widget disposal
- Properly handles async operations with proper error handling

## Benefits
- ✅ Users can switch accounts seamlessly without closing the app
- ✅ No data leakage between user sessions
- ✅ Improved user experience and security
- ✅ Consistent behavior across logout and delete account flows
