## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Before deploying to production:

1. **Configure Production Email Service:**
   - Use SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
   - Don't use personal Gmail in production
   
2. **Set Manager Email:**
   ```env
   MANAGER_EMAIL=admin@salespulse.com
   ```

3. **Configure Queue (Recommended):**
   ```env
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
   ```
   Then run: `php artisan queue:work`

4. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Test with real email addresses
   - Check spam folders
   - Verify all content displays correctly
   - Test on mobile email clients

5. **Monitor Logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

## 📝 Customization

### Change Manager Email:
Edit `.env`:
```env
MANAGER_EMAIL=newemail@domain.com
```

### Modify Email Content:
Edit templates in `resources/views/emails/`:
- `welcome-user.blade.php`
- `new-user-notification.blade.php`

### Change Email Subject:
Edit Mailable classes in `app/Mail/`:
- `WelcomeUserMail.php`
- `NewUserNotificationMail.php`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

1. Check logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify SMTP credentials in `.env`
3. Test mail config: `php artisan tinker` then `Mail::raw(...)`
4. Check if port 587 is open
5. For Gmail, use App Password (not regular password)

### Emails Going to Spam?

1. Set up SPF/DKIM records for your domain
2. Use professional email service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
3. Use verified sending domain
4. Test with mail-tester.com
