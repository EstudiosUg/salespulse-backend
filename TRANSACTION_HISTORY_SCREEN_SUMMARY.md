## Code Structure

### TransactionHistoryScreen Widget

```dart
enum TransactionType { sales, expenses }

class TransactionHistoryScreen extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
  final TransactionType initialType;
  
  const TransactionHistoryScreen({
    super.key,
    this.initialType = TransactionType.sales,
  });
}
```

### State Variables:
- `_selectedType`: Current transaction type (sales or expenses)
- `_selectedMonth`: Currently selected month filter (null = all months)
- `_searchQuery`: Current search query string

### Main UI Components:
1. **Type Selector** - Toggle between Sales and Expenses
2. **Filter Section** - Search bar and month filter
3. **Transaction List** - Dynamically shows sales or expenses based on type

---

## Navigation Implementation

### Dashboard â†’ Transaction History

**From Sales History:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const TransactionHistoryScreen(
      initialType: TransactionType.sales,
    ),
  ),
);
```

**From Expenses History:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const TransactionHistoryScreen(
      initialType: TransactionType.expenses,
    ),
  ),
);
```

---

## UI/UX Features

### Type Selector Design
- Segmented control style with two options
- Active option highlighted with color and icon
- Smooth visual feedback on tap
- Sales = Primary color (blue)
- Expenses = Error color (red)

### Search Bar
- Contextual placeholder text based on selected type
- Search icon prefix
- Rounded corners with surface container background
- Real-time filtering as user types

### Month Filter
- Calendar icon button
- Shows selected month in readable format (e.g., "October 2024")
- "All Months" when no filter applied
- Clear button appears when month is selected
- Native date picker for month selection

### Transaction Cards
- Card-based design with rounded corners
- Icon indicating transaction type
- Sales: Shopping bag icon (primary color)
- Expenses: Receipt icon (error color)
- Commission status badges for sales
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Amount prominently displayed on the right

### Empty State
- Large icon (shopping bag for sales, receipt for expenses)
- Clear message: "No [type] found"
- Helpful subtitle: "Try adjusting your filters"
- Centered layout

---

## Data Flow

1. **Screen Initialization**
   - Receives `initialType` parameter
   - Sets `_selectedType` state
   - Watches appropriate provider (salesNotifierProvider or expensesNotifierProvider)

2. **Type Toggle**
   - User taps Sales or Expenses button
   - State updates via `setState()`
   - UI rebuilds showing correct data

3. **Filtering**
   - Search query updates state on every keystroke
   - Month filter updates state when month selected
   - Filters applied to data in build method
   - UI rebuilds with filtered results

4. **Data Refresh**
   - Pull-to-refresh gesture detected
   - Invalidates appropriate provider
   - Provider refetches data from backend
   - UI rebuilds with fresh data

---

## Filtering Logic

### Search Filter:
```dart
// For Sales
final matchesSearch = _searchQuery.isEmpty ||
    sale.productName.toLowerCase().contains(_searchQuery);

// For Expenses
final matchesSearch = _searchQuery.isEmpty ||
    expense.title.toLowerCase().contains(_searchQuery);
```

### Month Filter:
```dart
final matchesMonth = _selectedMonth == null ||
    (transaction.date.year == _selectedMonth!.year &&
     transaction.date.month == _selectedMonth!.month);
```

### Combined:
```dart
return matchesSearch && matchesMonth;
```

---

## Styling Consistency

- Uses app's ColorScheme throughout
- Respects theme (dark/light mode)
- Consistent with existing dashboard design
- Rounded corners (12-16px border radius)
- Proper spacing (8-20px margins/paddings)
- Typography follows Material Design guidelines

---

## Responsive Design

- ListView for scrollable content
- Proper keyboard handling for search
- Pull-to-refresh gesture support
- Handles various screen sizes
- Cards adapt to available width

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Filtering**: Filters applied in build method, no unnecessary rebuilds
2. **ListView Builder**: Only builds visible items
3. **Provider Caching**: Uses Riverpod's caching for data
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Shows appropriate widget based on state
5. **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded on demand via providers

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential features that could be added:

1. **Transaction Details View**
   - Tap on transaction to view full details
   - Edit/Delete functionality

2. **Advanced Filters**
   - Date range selection (start date to end date)
   - Amount range filter
   - Supplier filter (for sales)
   - Category filter (for expenses)

3. **Sorting Options**
   - Sort by date (ascending/descending)
   - Sort by amount (high to low, low to high)
   - Sort by product name/title (alphabetical)

4. **Export Functionality**
   - Export filtered results to PDF/Excel
   - Share transactions via email

5. **Statistics**
   - Show total for filtered results
   - Average transaction amount
   - Count of transactions

6. **Bulk Actions**
   - Select multiple transactions
   - Bulk delete
   - Bulk mark commission as paid (for sales)
